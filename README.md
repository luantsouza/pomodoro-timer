# About

This is another challenge from the site 'Frontend Mentor'. In this challenge I built a article preview component that shows some text to the user, and there is a option to share the content in social media when click the button on the right. The languages used in this project are HTML, CSS3 and Javascript. I hope you enjoy my work ;)
